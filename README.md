# DSA Practice Repository 💻

Welcome to the digital evidence of my struggle against Data Structures and Algorithms.

This repository exists because:

* Interviews are scary 😭
* LeetCode exists 😐
* And apparently, “knowing syntax” is not the same as “getting a job.”

So here we are.

---

## Why this repo exists 🤔

I didn’t wake up one day and say,
“Wow, I love solving array problems at 6 AM.”

No.
This repo was created out of:

* Fear 😶
* Deadlines ⏰
* Comparison with other people on LinkedIn 😵
* And the dream of a stable paycheck 💸

Mostly the paycheck.

---

## Goals 🎯

* Build strong DSA fundamentals
* Prepare for coding interviews
* Stop panicking when someone says “time complexity”
* Eventually solve problems without emotional damage

---

## Current Strategy 🧠

1. Solve problems daily
2. Suffer a little
3. Understand the solution
4. Feel powerful for 12 minutes ⚡
5. Repeat the next day

---

## Topics Covered 📚

* Arrays
* Strings
* Hashing
* Linked Lists
* Stacks & Queues
* Trees
* Graphs
* Dynamic Programming (the final boss 👹)

## Rules I’m trying to follow 🧾

* Consistency over perfection
* One problem a day is still progress
* Confusion today = clarity tomorrow
* Quitting is not an option (unfortunately)

---

## Motivation 🚀

Every solved problem is:

* One step closer to a job
* One step away from tutorial hell
* One step toward financial independence
* And one step toward proving my past self wrong

---

## Disclaimer ⚠️

This repository may contain:

* Self trust
* Overcomplicated solutions
* Questionable variable names
* Existential comments inside code

All of this is part of the growth process.
