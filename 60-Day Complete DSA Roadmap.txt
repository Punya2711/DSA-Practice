Last 4 Days: Revision + Mock Interviews

This is your confidence week.

Daily:

2 mixed problems

1 timed mock test

Revise weak topics

Focus on:

Arrays

Strings

Hashing

Trees

Binary search

Total Problem Count

If you follow this plan:

Average: 5 problems/day

60 days total

≈300 problems

That’s very strong for a 2nd year student.

Daily Routine (Simple Version)

Every day:

3 problems from current topic

1 revision problem

1 random interview problem

Total: 5 problems

By the end of 60 days, you should:

Be comfortable with:

Arrays

Strings

Hashing

Binary search

Recursion

Linked lists

Stacks/queues

Trees

Basic graphs

Greedy

Heaps

That is internship interview ready.
